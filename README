Magnet: Management Agent

AMQP Clients

November 2008

There are several usages of magnet.
The mgmt module is basically a provisioning agent. service.py contains
definitions of Twisted service having to do with provisioning a system of
virtual machines. 

Amazon is currently the only cloud used for deploying virtual machines,
interfaced using the Boto tool (wrapper of amazon aws api).
An interface to another cloud could easily be swapped in.
