Magnet

How to get started using it now:

Install the dependencies:

Twisted Python
--------------
easy_install twisted

txAMQP
------
easy_install txamqp


Install the Magnet package:
---------------------------
(in the same directory of this readme file)
python setup.py install

Run examples
------------
The mangnet.conf file included in the examples directory uses the AMQP
broker running on the CI development server called amoeba.ucsd.edu.
This is done for your convenience to see an example work with no work. 
To run magnet using your own broker, edit the magnet.conf file accordingly. 
The recommended broker is the RabbitMQ broker, version 1.6 or later.


The magnet.conf file can be moved to .magnet.conf (note the prepended '.')
the home directory of the user running programs using magnet. When the
preactor is started in your magnet program, it will first look for a
magnet.conf in the directory you are running from, if there is not one in
the current directory it will then look for ~/.mangnet.conf. This allows
you to use ~/.magnet.conf as a global configuration that can be locally
overridden but putting a mangnet.conf in the actual run directory.
