AMQP messaging agents with simple configuration and minimal coding.
 - Quickly configure messaging agents without writing boiler plate amqp
   library code.
 - Run multiple message consumers concurrently


Agents
======
An Agent represents an AMQP connection to a broker server. By itself, and
Agent doesn't do much besides establish the connection; it needs one or
more Actors to do messaging. 


Actors
======
An Actor represents an AMQP channel within a connection. 
An Actor must belong to an Agent in order to do anything interesting. 


Looking at things from the Twisted Application Framework perspective,
Agents and Actors are both services. In particular, an Agent is a
multi-service that supervises one or more Actor services.
