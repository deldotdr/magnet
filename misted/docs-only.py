@section What is Misted?

Welcome to Misted, the successor to Magnet. Misted, whose name may change without

twisted-compatible connection abstraction based on 'pockets', which are one
letter different from sockets.

@section Coming Attractions
Much more docs on the way, keep an eye out at http://amoeba.ucsd.edu/doxygen/Misted
